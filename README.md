# Noto App

Noto is a sleek and simple notes app, representing the culmination of my first full-stack project. Developed entirely on my own, this project allowed me to dive deep into various technologies and concepts, particularly in the realm of React.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Express.js (Backend)**
- **MongoDB (Database)**

## Key Features

- **Sign up and login functionality**: Implemented using encryption to secure passwords before storing them in the database with bcrypt.
- **Fetching notes of the logged-in user**: Utilized session management to ensure users only see their own notes.
- **Demo Video**: See below for a demonstration of the app's key features.

## About the Project

Creating Noto was an enriching experience that allowed me to broaden my knowledge and skills in React. While I am not experienced in design, I made every effort to make the app look good while focusing on functionality and performance.

## Learning Experience

Throughout the development of Noto, I encountered challenges that pushed me to expand my understanding of React and deepen my understanding of fundamental concepts. Despite the time it took to complete this project, the journey was invaluable in enhancing my confidence and flexibility as a developer.
